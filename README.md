# AI-APP-TS325: Utilizing robust Azure demos for real-world common scenarios

From App Service to AKS, Logic Apps to Functions, Cosmos DB to Cognitive Services and IoT, the SmartHotel360 and Tailwind Traders apps highlight both our Azure cloud capabilities, IoT and DevOps offerings. Since Connect(); we've been able to use SmartHotel360 and Tailwind Traders applications source code in a myriad of ways, from showing cloud-native development to demonstrating how customers can migrate to Azure. In this session you'll learn the architecture, components and get some tips on using it for demonstrating Azure, Azure DevOps, Xamarin, and more.
