The Tailwind Traders team uses GitHub for hosting their source code and use Azure Pipelines for continuous integration and continuous delivery to quickly deploy their changes to Azure. Their public website will be hosted in Azure, and they want to automate the entire process so that they can spin up all the infrastructure needed to deploy and host the application without any manual intervention.
